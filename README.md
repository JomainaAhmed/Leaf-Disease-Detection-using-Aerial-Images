# Leaf_Disease_Prediction
Developed a leaf disease prediction model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. Employed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. Achieved model accuracy through validation and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
